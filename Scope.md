# Scope

An important concept in JavaScript development. There are generally two types of scope: Local Scope and Global Scope. <sup>[1][1],[2][2]</sup>

## Local Scope

Variables and functions declared within an object or function are locally scoped to that function.

## Global Scope

Anything else that isn't locally scoped to another function or object is part of the global scope.
