# JavaScript Cheat Sheets

Today, you all will be building review materials for what we've learned in JavaScript so far. You will be building markdown documents collaboratively to use moving forwards. This project will mimic a "true to life" development environment where multiple people will be working on different features. 

## Suggested Workflow
There are already some GitHub issues on this repository. Feel free to add more if you want! You can also add comments to those issues to add notes on what should be in each "cheat sheet". We recommend [assigning yourself](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/) to the issue you are working on. Also, use Slack to communicate with your team.

You must create unique examples of the JavaScript features for these cheat sheets, though the formatting is up to you all. This means that copying from the lesson plans is not sufficient!

GitHub also generates static websites from markdown pages and hosts them on GitHub. We already have this repository deployed as a GitHub pages site, [check it out](https://ga-wdi-exercises.github.io/wdi22-javascript-cheatsheets/)! If you create new markdown files, then they will become pages for your site. We recommend creating one markdown file for each topic.

## Steps
* Fork this repository, clone it locally, then add in your markdown.
* After you add some code, push it to GitHub enterprise. Create a pull request to this repository.
* The instructors will be accepting pull requests and commenting on them throughout the day.
* Whenever a new changed is merged into this repository, you will need to update your local version of the project. You will need to [add a second remote to your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and then [merge the upstream changes into your local repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

## Requirements
Each student must put in meaningful effort and contribute to this project. Each student should have at least three pull requests over the course of the day.

## Support
Ali and James will be online merging pull requests and responding to student questions over Slack. If you think the answer will be helpful for multiple students, feel free to use #wdi22-discussion on slack to ask that question and we will respond there! You can also direct message us.

# Example
[Here's](https://www.alispit.tel/coding-cheat-sheets/) an example I made of a finished cheat sheet site and the [code](https://github.com/aspittel/coding-cheat-sheets) for it!
