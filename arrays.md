#_**Introduction to Arrays**_

### Arrays are a collection of global related data types and are ordered in an organized index. They are used to implement a ton of other data structures â€“ like queues, stacks, lists, and sometimes strings. There are many ways you can use arrays to manipulate your program, but we will simply state here what they are.

```js
Example: x = [1, 2, 3]
```

In order to understand what an array is, you *must* understand that indexing in an array begins at 0. **In other words, the first element will begin at "0", the second element in an array will be put as "1", and so on.** Arrays are used to access elements.

Next, we will cover properties of Arrays.
